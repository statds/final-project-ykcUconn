  abstract  = "311 is a telephone and web service that allows residents of many
               cities to report nonemergency concerns and problems with city
               services to their local government. This article explores the
               Census-tract-level variation in 311 contacting volume within New
               York City. Drawing on previous research on citizen--government
               interaction, service delivery, and civic engagement, the article
               focuses on how contacting propensity and condition both explain
               spatial variations in contacting volume. These explanations are
               tested using indicators that describe the people who live and
               work in the space, the housing in the space, the economic
               development of the space, and the space's representation in city
               government. 311 contacting is divided into three categories
               (government-provided goods, graffiti, and noise) that are
               separately analyzed using regression models that account for
               spatial and serial dependence. The article also discusses the
               theoretical and methodological challenges of using 311 data to
               understand the distribution of problems within a city.",
